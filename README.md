The software folder contains the various packages in Mathematica, Maxima, and Macsyma my students, collaborators and I have written. They are organized in subfolders.

The various codes, data files, and notebooks in each subfolder can be downloaded by first clicking in the file name (showing the content of the file) 
and then downloading the file via the down(load) arrow. Make sure to keep the structure of the folders and subfolders. 

The software is free of use and open source. It can be adjusted for your purpose. However, proper credit should be given 
to the original developers (my students, collaborators, and myself). 

In case of trouble or if you have questions, please contact me at whereman@mines.edu.
