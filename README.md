Dear users, 

The folder `willyhereman' contains repositories with various packages for Mathematica, Maxima, and Macsyma that my students, collaborators, and I have written. They are organized according to purpose and computer algebra system. For example, PainleveTest-Mathematica is our PainleveTest code that (only) works under Mathematica. 

The various codes, data files, and notebooks in each repository can be downloaded by first clicking on the file name (showing the content of the file) and then downloading the file via the down(load) arrow. 

If you want all the software in a repository (recommended): Go to the desidered repository, first click on the "<> code" icon on the top left. Then click the green Code button. In the menu that opens, click Download ZIP to create a zip file. The entire repository will be downloaded to your computer as a zipped file which can be opened with 7 zip, WinZip, and the like. 

The software is free of use and open source. It can be adjusted for your purpose. However, proper credit should be given 
to the original developers (my students, collaborators, and myself). Please read the licence statement in the software repository. 

In case of trouble or if you have questions, please contact me at whereman@mines.edu.
