The folder `willyhereman' contains repositories with various packages for Mathematica, Maxima, and Macsyma that my students, collaborators, and I have written. They are organized according to purpose and underlying computer algebra system. For example, PainleveTest-Mathematica is our PainleveTest code that only works under Mathematica. 

The various codes, data files, and notebooks in each repository can be downloaded by first clicking in the file name (showing the content of the file) and then downloading the file via the down(load) arrow. 

If you want all the software in a repository: On the repository page, first click on the "<> code" icon on the top left. then click the green Code button. In the menu that appears, click Download ZIP to create a zip file. The entire repository will be downloaded to your computer as a zipped file.

The software is free of use and open source. It can be adjusted for your purpose. However, proper credit should be given 
to the original developers (my students, collaborators, and myself). Plese read the licence statement in the software repository. 

In case of trouble or if you have questions, please contact me at whereman@mines.edu.
