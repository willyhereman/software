The software folder contains the various packages in Mathematica, Maxima, and Macsyma my students, collaborators, and I have written. They are organized in subfolders.

The various codes, data files, and notebooks in each subfolder can be downloaded by first clicking in the file name (showing the content of the file) 
and then downloading the file via the down(load) arrow. Make sure to keep the structure of the folders and subfolders. 

The above would be cumbersome it there are many separate files in a folder. Therefore, we have provided a zip file per folder with the content of that folder (and subfolders). 

If you want all the software: On the main repository page, click the green Code button. 3. In the menu that appears, click Download ZIP. The entire repository will be downloaded to your device as a zipped file.

The software is free of use and open source. It can be adjusted for your purpose. However, proper credit should be given 
to the original developers (my students, collaborators, and myself). 

In case of trouble or if you have questions, please contact me at whereman@mines.edu.
