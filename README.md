The software folder contains the various packages in Mathematica, Maxima, and Macsyma I have written, organized in subfolders.

The various codes, data files, and notebooks can be downloaded by first clicking in the file name (showing the content of the file) 
and then downloading the file via the down(load) arrow. 

The software is free of use is open source and can be adjusted for your purpose. However, proper credit should be given 
to the original developers (my students, collaborators and myself). 

In case of trouble, please contact me at whereman@mines.edu.
